As a Computer Science Student in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, I was required to take the Introduction to Computer Science course.
This is a course that teaches you the basic and advanced concepts of programming, using Python as the main language.
It lasted 11 weeks (summer semester), in which, we've submitted a total of 9 exercises in various fields and topics.
