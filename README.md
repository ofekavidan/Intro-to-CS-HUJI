# Introduction to Computer Science

As a Computer Science Student in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, I was required to take the Introduction to Computer Science course.
This is a course that teaches you the basic and advanced concepts of programming, using Python as the main language.
It lasted 14 weeks, in which, we've submitted a total of 12 exercises in various fields and topics.
